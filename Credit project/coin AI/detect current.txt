Sure, here is the Arduino code to detect current on a wire without using sensors, with an if statement to check for current:

```
// Define the input pin
const int inputPin = 2;

// Define the resistor
const int resistorValue = 1000;

// Setup
void setup() {
  // Initialize the serial port
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Set the input pin as an input
  pinMode(inputPin, INPUT);
}

// Loop
void loop() {
  // Read the voltage across the resistor
  int voltage = analogRead(inputPin);

  // Calculate the current
  float current = voltage * 1000 / resistorValue;

  // Check if the current is greater than a certain threshold
  if (current > 10) {
    // If it is, print "Current is flowing"
    Serial.println("Current is flowing");
  } else {
    // Otherwise, print "Current is not flowing"
    Serial.println("Current is not flowing");
  }
}
```

This code is the same as the previous code, with the addition of an if statement. The if statement checks if the current is greater than a certain threshold. If it is, then the code prints "Current is flowing" to the serial port. Otherwise, the code prints "Current is not flowing" to the serial port.

The threshold value can be adjusted to change the sensitivity of the current detection. A higher threshold value will make it less likely that the code will detect current, while a lower threshold value will make it more likely that the code will detect current.

I hope this helps!
