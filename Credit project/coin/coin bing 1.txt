A buck converter is a type of DC-DC converter that steps down the input voltage to a lower output voltage. To detect if a buck converter is powered using an Arduino Pro Mini, you need to measure the output voltage of the converter and compare it with a threshold value. You can use an analog input pin of the Arduino to read the output voltage and a digital output pin to indicate the status of the converter. Here is an example code that you can use:

```c
// Define the analog input pin connected to the output of the buck converter
#define BUCK_PIN A0
// Define the digital output pin connected to an LED or a buzzer
#define STATUS_PIN 13
// Define the threshold voltage for detecting if the buck converter is powered (in volts)
#define THRESHOLD 5.0
// Define the reference voltage for the analog input (in volts)
#define REFERENCE 5.0

void setup() {
  // Set the status pin as output
  pinMode(STATUS_PIN, OUTPUT);
  // Set the reference voltage for the analog input
  analogReference(DEFAULT);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the analog value from the buck pin
  int buck_value = analogRead(BUCK_PIN);
  // Convert the analog value to voltage
  float buck_voltage = (buck_value / 1023.0) * REFERENCE;
  // Compare the buck voltage with the threshold voltage
  if (buck_voltage >= THRESHOLD) {
    // Turn on the status pin if the buck converter is powered
    digitalWrite(STATUS_PIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    // Turn off the status pin if the buck converter is not powered
    digitalWrite(STATUS_PIN, LOW);
  }
}
```

This code assumes that you have a buck converter circuit similar to [this one](^1^) or [this one](^2^). You can adjust the threshold voltage and the reference voltage according to your circuit specifications. You can also use a potentiometer to vary the output voltage of the buck converter and see how it affects the status pin.

I hope this helps you with your project. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. 96
